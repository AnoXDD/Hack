    CONSOLE APPLICATION : HackGame Project Overview
========================================================================

This is a game based on console. The target of the game is for the user to play a programmer and explore as the story expends. 

Currently this game has finished its first episode. 

I would like to add tab autocomplete to make the command run faster. I tried GNUWin32 but it did not work for me (readline5.dll is something wrong, probably incompatibility of c and cpp). I am not sure if I will write its sequel.

This game started 020814, everything written and designed by Anoxic. All rights reserved.
