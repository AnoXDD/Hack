--Prob: display Pluto's email's detail
--Prob: MIA should be closed after the mission (now it is still available after Foxtrot is imprisoned)
Debug: not sure if comm is not accessible while Foxtrot is imprisoned
--Prob: plugins don't have to be transmitted to complete this level	
Debug all the levels, no runtime errors
--Todo: write outro()
--Todo: add line code to count how many lines the user has input so far

--Todo: outro: congratualtions big font size!!!!
--Todo: change the password of Jason (code and html);
Todo: exit + save (still debugging)

012615
Todo: add exit menu
	Idea: create a new class. Everytime in the loop of start_game(), check if its exiting status. If (exit_status) {exit_lopp;} And switch (exit_status) correspondingly change outro (game over or save the game)
