/*
 account.h
 This class stands for a user account.
 The account can be used to send / receive messages.
 The variable of para in this class contains the pair of reset
 questions if there are any.

 Process of attempting to log in into an account but failed:
 1. Check if "reset_limit" is > 0 (reset enabled)
 2. (If enabled) Increment "fail" by 1 and test if it is >= "reset_lim" (reset triggered)
 3. (If triggered) Call this->reset()
 4.1 If "reset_password" is empty, lock the account right away
 4.2 Else, test if "para" of "account" is empty (have questions to answered before reset?)
 4.2.1 (If so) Iterate to prompt user to answer all of the questions
	Any failure to provide correct key will terminate the reset process immediately
 5. Reset the password to "reset_password"
 6. Reset reset_limit
